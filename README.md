# Weed Strain Search & Clicker Game

## Overview

This project is a fun and interactive web application that combines two features: a **Marijuana Strain Search** and a **Clicker Game**. The strain search utilizes data from the **Leafly** website, providing users with the ability to explore different cannabis strains and learn more about their characteristics. Alongside this, a small **Clicker Game** allows users to grow and harvest marijuana plants, upgrade their farming equipment, and collect currency to improve their experience. 

## Features

### 1. **Marijuana Strain Search**:
- **Search Functionality**: The search bar allows users to input the name of any marijuana strain, and the application fetches relevant details about that strain from Leafly, such as its effects, THC content, and more.
- **Leafly Integration**: This feature uses the Leafly API to access up-to-date information about different cannabis strains. It enables users to discover new strains and learn about their properties before making a choice.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The results are displayed in a simple and easy-to-read format, making it quick for users to find the information they're looking for.

### 2. **Clicker Game**:
- **Grow Your Plants**: In the clicker game section, users can click to grow marijuana plants. The plants go through multiple growth stages before reaching full maturity, at which point they can be harvested.
- **Harvesting**: Once the plants reach the full growth stage, users can "snip" or harvest the buds, adding to their stash (currency).
- **Upgrades**: Users can purchase upgrades to increase the efficiency of their plant growth, such as faster growth rates or more plants at once.
- **Idle Growth**: When certain upgrades are purchased, plants will continue to grow even when the user is not actively clicking, simulating idle farming growth.

## How to Use

1. **Strain Search**:
   - Enter the name of a marijuana strain into the search bar.
   - Click the "Search" button to view detailed information about the strain, including effects, THC levels, and more.

2. **Clicker Game**:
   - Click the "Grow" button to start growing your plants.
   - As your plants mature, you can harvest them for stash (currency).
   - Use your stash to buy upgrades like faster growth or additional plants.
   - Once you reach certain milestones, the plants will start growing passively, even when you're not interacting with the game.

## Future Improvements

- Integration of more detailed strain data, such as flavor profiles and medical benefits.
- Additional upgrades and features for the clicker game, like more plant varieties or new ways to collect stash.
- Improvements to the user interface to enhance the overall user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure and layout of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling the webpage to ensure it looks good on all devices.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive functionality such as the strain search and the clicker game logic.
